## ReverseTCPy
**ReverseTCPy** is a Python 3 based reverse TCP tool. **FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!**

## Motivation
I started this project for three main reasons:
1. To learn to program using Python.
2. Create a way to gain a shell without being detected by Defender on Win10.
3. Stop being such a script kiddy and learn something new.

## Installation & Usage
Listener:
If you need to change the port or host IP, then open it with a text editor.

* `git clone https://github.com/mcgrenoa/python-reverse-tcp`
* `cd ReverseTCPy`
* `python3 listener.py`

Client:
If you need to change the port or host IP, then open it with a text editor. 

**If you want to run the client on Windows without install Python, you can use pyinstaller. Make sure you have any options set correctly!**

Pyinstaller can be found [here](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

To package the client with pyinstaller:

* `pyinstaller -D -w path/to/file/`

If you want to run the client **using** python:

* `python3 client.py`

## Issues & Updates
This is my first Python project, so I guarentee there will be issues. If you come across an issue, please let me know!
I do plan on updating this quite a bit.

If you have any ideas that you'd like to see implemented, let me know and I'll try to work them in.
